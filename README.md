# ENPM661-Project2

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to find the optimal path through a Cartesian maze with obstacles for both a point and rigid (circular) robot. The search algorithm that is used to find the path is Dijkstra, which is similar to Breadth First Search but with the addition of consideration to movement cost. For this project the robot is able to move in 8 directions: (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). The cardinal directions (N,E,S,W) have a cost of 1 and the sub-cardinal directions (NE,SE,SW,NW) have a cost of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{2}"> . There are two mazes included in the repository.

Maze 1, which has a grid size of (200 x 100) and two obstacles a square and a circle.

Maze 2 is more complicated with a larger grid size of 300x200 and 6 obstacles, a concave polygon, a circle, an ellipse, a rotated rectangle, and a diamond.

## Point Robot

For a point robot the 

## Creating New Mazes

The maze is generated by reading in a text file. New mazes can be generated by creating new text files that follow the same format. 

The first parameters needed to establish a maze is the height and width of the maze in points. This can be specified by the lines. **Note it is crucial to use a colon** `:`

`height: XX`
`width: XX`

The code currently supports four different types of obstacles; circles, ellipses, polygons, and rotated rectangles. Depending on the type of obstacle you want to generate, different parameters are needed. 

### Circle
For a circle the file needs to contain a center point (x,y) and a radius (r). You may also specify a color in BGR (B,G,R). Each value should be between 0 and 255. The lines in text file should look like this

    circle
        center: x,y
        radius: r
        color: B,G,R

### Ellipse
To add a rotated rectangle obstacle you need to specify the center point (x,y), the major and minor axis (a1,a2), the rotation angle in degrees, and the start and end angles in degrees. To specify the entire ellipse the start should be 0 and the end 360. You may also specify a color in BGR (B,G,R). The lines in text file should look like this

    ellipse
        center: x,y
        axis: a1,a2
        angle: 0 
        start: 0
        end: 360
        color: B,G,R

### Polygon
To add a polygon obstacle you need to specify all points that make up the exterior of the polygon in the form (x,y). The program will draw lines between each point so the order matters. You may also specify a color in BGR (B,G,R). The lines in text file should look like this

    polygon
        point: x1,y1
        point: x2,y2
        point: x3,y3
        point: x4,y4
        color: B,G,R

### Rotated Rectangle
To add a rotated rectangle obstacle you need to specify the position of the starting corner (the code currently only supports the starting corner as the bottom right corner), the length of both sides l1 and l2, and the rotation angle. You may also specify a color in BGR (B,G,R).
